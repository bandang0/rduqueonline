## Welcome!

I am a graduate student working on gamma-ray bursts and related phenomena at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (CNRS/Sorbonne Université). Frédéric Daigne and Robert Mochkovitch are my advisors, and my Ph.D. entitled "Gamma-ray Bursts in the gravitational wave era" is expected to be defended in June 2021.

My work deploys in **three new axes of high-energy astrophysics studies** recently opened by the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves, which was inaugurated by GW170817.

These axes are **(i) population studies**, aiming at predicting features of the population of gravitational-wave merger events with EM counterparts expected from future observing runs, **(ii) multi-messenger prospective studies**, exploring what new methods and insight on GRBs and their progenitors multi-messenger observations will allow, and **(iii) upgraded classical GRB studies**, which look back to existing GRB data with a perspective enhanced by the lessons of GW170817 on the GRB phenomenon.

In addition to this research activity, I am invested as a **Burst Advocate** in the French-Chinese SVOM high-energy satellite mission and have led optical **follow-up campaigns of gravitational wave alerts** with the mission's ground segment.
