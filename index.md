I am a theoretical high-energy astrophysics graduate student at the [*Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris*](http://www.iap.fr/) (CNRS/Sorbonne Université), under the supervision of Prof. Frédéric Daigne and Dr. Robert Mochkovitch. My Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "Compact Object Coalescences and Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Gravitational-Wave Era". I will defend it on September 10, 2021.

My research interests are gamma-ray bursts, binary neutron star mergers and their electromagnetic counterparts, multi-messenger cosmology, relativistic jets and high-energy emission processes in general. In addition to my theoretical activity, I am invested as a Burst Advocate in the French-Chinese high-energy satellite mission [SVOM](https://www.svom.eu/#filter=.accueil) and lead optical follow-up campaigns of gravitational-wave alerts with the mission's ground segment.

I am also invested in teaching at the *Observatoire de Paris*, where I tutor classes in statistical physics, astronomical observations and data analysis at the Master level. I try to keep an open ear towards the advances of theoretical physics through some of my friends from undergrad, with whom I shared a rather formal education in physics and mathematics. I like to use this insight to compose problem sets for my teaching. 

In October 2021 I will join the [Relativistic Astrophysics Group](https://relastro.uni-frankfurt.de/) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe Universität Frankfurt. While there I will work on the [JETSET ERC Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884631).

I am also co-organizer of a weekly multi-messenger astronomy journal club founded by both the IAP and the *Astroparticule et Cosmologie* laboratory in Paris. Our interests are broad, as one can witness on our [archiving webpage](https://bandang0.github.io/mmajconline/). If you would like to contribute during one of our sessions, please contact us!
