## Welcome!

I am a high-energy astrophysics graduate student at the [Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris](http://www.iap.fr/) (CNRS/Sorbonne Université). Prof. Frédéric Daigne and Dr. Robert Mochkovitch are my doctoral advisors, and my Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "The Physics of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Gravitational-Wave Era". I will defend it in June 2021.

I work in **three new axes of high-energy astrophysics studies** opened by the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational-waves:

1. **multi-messenger population studies**, aiming to predict and describe the population of gravitational-wave merger events with electromagnetic counterparts
2. **multi-messenger prospective studies**, exploring how to leverage these forthcoming events to better understand gamma-ray bursts, their environments and progenitors
3. **upgraded classical gamma-ray burst studies**, which look back to existing gamma-ray burst data with a modelling perspective enhanced by the first lessons of the multi-messenger era.

In addition to my theoretical activity, I am invested as a **Burst Advocate** in the French-Chinese high-energy satellite mission [SVOM](https://www.svom.eu/#filter=.accueil) and lead optical **follow-up campaigns of gravitational-wave alerts** with the mission's ground segment.
