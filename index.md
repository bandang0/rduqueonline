## Welcome!

I am a high-energy astrophysics graduate student at the [Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris](http://www.iap.fr/) (CNRS/Sorbonne Université). Prof. Frédéric Daigne and Dr. Robert Mochkovitch are my doctoral advisors, and my Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "The Physics of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Gravitational-Wave Era". I will defend it in June 2021.

In October 2021 I will join the [Relativistic Astrophysics Group](https://relastro.uni-frankfurt.de/) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe Universität Frankfurt. While there I will work on the [JETSET ERC Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884631).

I follow a **multimessenger approach to high-energy astrophysics**, by making multimessenger source population studies and developing original multimessenger methods to study the progenitors and environments of binary compact object mergers. My methodology is mainly **analytical and semi-analytical**, though I have recently collaborated to projects involving heavy numerical statistics, and I have some experience with computational fluid dynamics software from my pre-doctoral years.

I try to keep an open ear towards the advances of **theoretical physics** through some of my friends from undergrad, with whom I shared a rather formal education in physics and mathematics. I like to use this insight to **compose problem sets for my teaching**.  

In addition to my theoretical activity, I am invested as a **Burst Advocate** in the French-Chinese high-energy satellite mission [SVOM](https://www.svom.eu/#filter=.accueil) and lead **optical follow-up campaigns of gravitational-wave alerts** with the mission's ground segment.

I am also co-organizer of a multimessenger astronomy journal club founded by both the IAP and the Astroparticule et Cosmologie laboratory in Paris. Our interests are broad, as one can witness on our [archiving webpage](https://bandang0.github.io/mmajconline/). If you would like to contribute during one of our sessions, please contact me!
