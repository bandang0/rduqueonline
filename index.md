## Welcome!

I am a graduate student working on gamma-ray bursts and related phenomena at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (CNRS/Sorbonne Université). Frédéric Daigne and Robert Mochkovitch are my advisors, and my Ph.D. defence is expected in June 2021.

This website contains useful information on my past and current scientific activities and other projects. Do not hesitate to contact me at the address below.
