### AstroReduce

[AstroReduce](https://github.com/bandang0/astro_reduce) is a simple astronomical image reduction program commissioned by the Observatoire de Paris for fast and straightforward reduction of series of images during pedagogical observing sessions at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. In addition to reducing stacks of astronomical images, AstroReduce interfaces with the [Astromatic](https://github.com/astromatic) software suite for rapid source extraction, photometry and astrometry.

Left is an image of M56 in the R band taken with the 120cm telescope at the Observatoire de Haute Provence and cleaned-up with AstroReduce. The project is under active development, do contact me to contribute!

### The Theia Gaussian optics simulator

<img src="https://bandang0.github.io/rduqueonline/img/theia.png" style="height: auto; width:40%; padding: 15px;" align="right"/>While at the Virgo interferometer in Cascina in 2017, I developed a Gaussian optics simulation tool tailored to gravitational interferometers. Right is a Theia simulation of the North End Bench of Virgo. Stray light rays can be seen coming out of the various optics. More information on Theia can be found [here](https://bandang0.github.io/theiaonline/).
